 CustomBadge.h
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CustomBadge is an UIView which draws a customizable badge on any other view.
 The latest version has separation between style and rendering.
 This class is the core of CustomBadge where the actual rendering happens.
 It recommended to use the convenient allocators instead of the init methods.
